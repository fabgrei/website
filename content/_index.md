# Fabian Greimel

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Mannheim. I will join the University of Amsterdam as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2020.

My job market paper argues that rising inequality fueled the American mortgage and house price booms prior to the financial crisis because households wanted to _keep up with the Joneses_. 

Here is a [video](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/videos/2020/fabian-greimel) from the ASSA meetings where I explain the paper in two minutes. 

Download my [Job Market Paper](https://gitlab.com/drechsel-grau-greimel/public/builds/artifacts/master/raw/falling-behind/paper/falling-behind-paper.pdf?job=compile_pdf_slides) and my [CV](/static/CV.pdf).
