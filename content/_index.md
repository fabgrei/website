# Fabian Greimel

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Mannheim. I will be on the job market this fall and available for interviews at the European Job Market for Economists in Rotterdam and the ASSA meetings in San Diego.

My job market paper argues that rising inequality fueled the American mortgage and house price booms prior to the financial crisis because households wanted to _keep up with the Joneses_.

Download my [Job Market Paper](https://gitlab.com/drechsel-grau-greimel/public/builds/artifacts/master/raw/falling-behind/paper/falling-behind-paper.pdf?job=compile_pdf_slides) and my [CV](/static/CV.pdf).
