_US States with higher growth in top incomes experience a stronger growth in house prices and non-rich mortgages---but no stronger growth in non-mortgage debt. Previously studied drivers of household debt cannot generate these novel findings. We propose rising income inequality and Keeping up with the richer Joneses as a complementary causal driver. We study a heterogeneous agent model where households care about how their house compares to the houses of the rich. We show analytically that mortgage debt of the non-rich is increasing in top incomes. To keep up with the rich, the non-rich substitute status-enhancing houses for status-neutral consumption. This mechanism generates about half of the observed increases in mortgage debt and house prices._

_Housing wealth effects---the reaction of consumption to changes in house prices---were at the heart of the Great Recession. Empirical and quantitative macroeconomic studies have found that housing wealth effects are stronger for more indebted households. One important policy implication is that lowering debt limits for borrowers will dampen the consumption slump in a house price bust. Such conclusions might be premature. We build a simple life-cycle model with housing with closed form solutions for housing wealth effects. We show that the strength of housing wealth effects crucially depends on the underlying household characteristics which also determine the debt levels. In this framework imposing one-size-fits-all debt limits does not necessarily mitigate housing wealth effects. To be effective, policies have to be tailored to borrowers' characteristics. Aggregate housing wealth effects can be reduced in three ways: (i) if old homeowners reduce their housing wealth; (ii) if the home ownership rate decreases; (iii) if agents have smaller houses. We provide a simple empirical test of our model predictions. When explaining housing wealth effects, we find that the level of mortgages turns statistically insignificant once relevant household characteristics (age and a proxy for housing preferences) are added._
