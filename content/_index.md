I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Mannheim.

I am interested in the distribution of household debt, where it comes from, and what it leads to (e.g. deeper financial crises). Moreover, I want to know what kind of financial markets a society should aim for.

**Falling Behind: Has Rising Inequality Fueled the American Debt Boom 1980--2007?** (joint with Moritz Drechsel-Grau)

Abstract:
_The household debt boom since 1980 is considered one of the main drivers of the Great Recession of 2007--9. In lockstep with household debt, income inequality has risen to new extremes. We build a model that links rising inequality to the mortgage debt boom. It builds on the old idea that people care about their social rank. When the middle class is falling behind ever richer rich, they take out credit in an attempt to keep up. Our mechanism is consistent with the following stylized facts: (i) Real mortgage debt, (ii) debt-service-to-income ratios and (iii) house sizes (in sqft) have increased since the 1980 across all income quintiles. This happened despite (iv) stagnating real incomes for the bottom 50% since the 1980s._

_We build a tractable dynamic network model with housing to illustrate how our mechanism generates these facts. We extend it to a quantitative model with heterogenous income profiles to show that the partial equilibrium results go through in general equilibrium. As a by-product, our quantitative model generates falling interest rates and a house price boom._

Will be presented at the Conference on _Financial Markets and Macroeconomic Performance_ at Goethe U Frankfurt (May 2018, Poster), the _SED Annual Meeting_ in Mexico City (June 2018, presented by MDG) and the _Econometric Society European Meeting_ in Cologne (August 2018).
