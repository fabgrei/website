Abstract:
_The U.S. household debt boom since 1980 is considered one of the main drivers of
the Great Recession of 2007–9. In lockstep with household debt, income inequality has
risen to new extremes. We build a model that links rising inequality to the mortgage
debt boom. It builds on the idea that households care about their social status. To
keep up with the ever richer Joneses, the middle class substitutes status-enhancing
houses for status-neutral consumption. These houses are mortgage-financed, creating
a debt boom across the income distribution. Using a stylized model we show analytically that aggregate debt increases as top incomes rise. In a quantitative general
equilibrium model we show that “Keeping up with the Joneses” and rising income in-
equality generate sizable booms in mortgage debt and house prices. By contrast, the Global Saving Glut hypothesis gives rise to a similar debt boom, but has a much weaker effect on house prices._

Abstract:
_Housing wealth effects---the reaction of consumption to changes in house prices---were at the heart of the Great Recession. Empirical and quantitative macroeconomic studies have found that housing wealth effects are stronger for more indebted households. One important policy implication is that lowering debt limits for borrowers will dampen the consumption slump in a house price bust. Such conclusions might be premature. We build a simple life-cycle model with housing with closed form solutions for housing wealth effects. We show that the strength of housing wealth effects crucially depends on the underlying household characteristics which also determine the debt levels. In this framework imposing one-size-fits-all debt limits does not necessarily mitigate housing wealth effects. To be effective, policies have to be tailored to borrowers' characteristics. Aggregate housing wealth effects can be reduced in three ways: (i) if old homeowners reduce their housing wealth; (ii) if the home ownership rate decreases; (iii) if agents have smaller houses. We provide a simple empirical test of our model predictions. When explaining housing wealth effects, we find that the level of mortgages turns statistically insignificant once relevant household characteristics (age and a proxy for housing preferences) are added._
