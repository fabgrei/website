**Falling Behind: Has Rising Inequality Fueled the American Debt Boom 1980--2007?** -- **_Job market paper_** (joint with Moritz Drechsel-Grau)

Abstract:
_The household debt boom since 1980 is considered one of the main drivers of
the Great Recession of 2007–9. In lockstep with household debt, income inequality
has risen to new extremes. We build a model that links rising inequality to the
mortgage debt boom. It builds on the old idea that people care about their social
status. In an attempt to keep up with ever richer Joneses, the middle class substitutes
status-enhancing houses for status-neutral consumption. These houses are mortgage-
financed, creating a debt boom across the income distribution. In a simplified version of the model we show analytically that aggregate debt is increasing in top incomes (holding interest rates fixed). In a quantitative general equilibrium life-cycle version we show that "Keeping up with the Joneses" and rising inequality generate a sizable debt doom, of the same magnitude as the Global Saving Glut (the main alternative explanation for the debt boom). Additionally our mechanism matches the house price boom, while the Global Saving Glut does not._

Draft is coming soon.

**Understanding Housing Wealth Effects: Debt, Homeownership and the Lifecycle** (joint with Frederick Zadow)

Abstract: _Housing wealth effects—the reaction of consumption to changes in house
prices—were at the heart of the Great Recession in the US. We provide a closed form
expression for housing wealth effects in tractable lifecycle model with 
housing and mortgages. We show that the effects are stronger for homeowners that are
older or have stronger preferences for housing. Contrary to previous empirical
literature there is an ambiguous effect of indebtedness. We argue how our structural
model can still generate these reduced form findings. Renters do not react to
house prices in our model. This means hat aggregate housing wealth effects are proportional to the
homeownership rate. A numerical example suggests that housing wealth effects can explain 30 % of the boom
and all of the bust in non-durable consumption. 7% of this can be explained
by the boom and bust in homeownership rates._
